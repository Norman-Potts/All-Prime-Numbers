# All Prime Numbers 

This is a Java program that calculates the first 1000 prime numbers 
then starts over and calculates the first 10 000 prime numbers.
This program makes multiple threads to calculate the numbers.
The threads store the prime numbers and are checked at the end for being 
correct.
